# bpi_led_test
Initial wiring test for the banana pi (BPI-M1)

# Motivation
In contrast to the Raspberry Pi the Banana Pi does wiring internally a little bit different when it comes to things like GPIO, SPI, PWM and things like that. So we have to check out how this works first: We use switching on and off a LED for that.
